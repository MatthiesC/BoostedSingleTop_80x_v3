/** \brief ttbar generator truth information
 * 
 * Interpret a vector of GenParticle as ttbar event, providing easier access to
 * the various components in the ttbar decay chain.
 * 
 * The class can either be used directly by passing the genparticles vector;
 * another option is to use the SingleTopGenProducer (see below), which writes the
 * result to the event container, where it can be accessed later.
 */
class SingleTopGen {
public:
  
  /** construct from genparticles.
   * 
   * The event should be an actual ttbar event, i.e.:
   *   - there are exactly two tops: one top and one anti-top
   *   - each top must have exactl two daughters
   *   - one of the top daughters must be a W
   *   - the Ws must have exactly two daughters
   * 
   * Note that it is allowed that more particles than those belonging to the ttbar system
   * are in genparts; those are ignored.
   * 
   * In case one of these conditions is not fulfilled, the behavior
   * depends on the throw_on_failure parameter: if it is true (the default), a runtime_error
   * is thrown with an explanation what failed. If it is false, no exception is thrown, but
   * not all contents is valid; most will return a 0 vector. The one thing guaranteed is that the
   * decaychannel will be e_notfound. If using throw_on_failure = false, it is thus a good idea
   * to check the decaychannel.
